## Code Release Status

The code for the HSLU CaptureStudio pipeline (capture, reconstruction, and export of dynamic point clouds and Gaussian splats) is currently being:

- cleaned up and modularized
- documented
- prepared for a public release

🧪 **Code release is in progress.**  
Please check back later for:

- installation instructions
- samples and configuration files
- scripts for reconstruction and export
